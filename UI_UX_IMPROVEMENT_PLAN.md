# UI_UX_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN

- control panels should be almost completely transparent. only control borders and handles should be opaque.
- control tabs should be better planned out:
   - saving should have its own tab, last
   - color tab should be positioned next to rings tab
   - dev-testing actions should be in a "dev" tab which should be easily disabled upon building and deploying
